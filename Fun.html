                                In 1835, the <i>New York Sun</i> newspaper wrote a series of six satiric articles that came to be known as "the Great Moon Hoax," with statements falsely attributed to Sir John Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals and even civilization living on the Moon. The articles described fantastic animals on the Moon, including bison, goats, unicorns, bipedal tail-less beavers and bat-like winged humanoids ("Vespertilio-homo") who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with "an immense telescope of an entirely new principle." The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and amanuensis of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious. Eventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the Sun causing the lens to act as a "burning glass," setting fire to the observatory.</p>

Transcription: Very curious accounts are given of Herschels new telescope; thee has probably seen the account. I should think that the account of its power is either very much exagerated or else entirely false. We hear however very little about it; can thee not give me an account of it in thy next? Some parts at least are false, as some say that he has seen all sorts and kinds of curious animals in the moon. That is rather a tough story at any rate.</figcaption>

                                <p><b>In Ancient Mythology</b><br />
                                The moon rabbit in folklore is a rabbit that lives on the Moon, based on pareidolia that identifies the markings of the Moon as a rabbit. The story exists in many cultures, prominently in East Asian folklore and Aztec mythology. In East Asia, it is seen pounding in a mortar and pestle, but the contents of the mortar differ among Chinese, Japanese, and Korean folklore. In Chinese folklore, it is often portrayed as a companion of the Moon goddess Chang'e, constantly pounding the elixir of life for her; but in Japanese and Korean versions, it is pounding the ingredients for rice cake.</p>
                                <p><b>In the Real World</b><br />
                                The year 1968 saw the U.S.S.R. turn once again to the animal kingdom for the first passengers of their new, manned moon ship. The first successful Zond ("probe") launch was on September 15, 1968, when Zond 5 was launched. A biological payload of turtles, wine flies, mealworms, plants, seeds, bacteria, and other living matter was included in the flight. On September 18, 1968, the spacecraft flew around the Moon.</p>
