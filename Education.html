						<h2><strong>Education</strong></h2>
						<p>Between the 1830s and 1870s, something changed in the way Haverford (and other colleges) viewed, treated,<br /> and talked about astronomy – wjay accounts for the shift from treating math &amp; science as a different way of<br /> thinking about the world to a legitimate field of study on its own, for the purpose of research?</p>

											<h3>Education</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In the 19th century, the telescope was much more advanced than was needed for the astronomical work being done in American colleges. American colleges provided a classical education meant to prepare clergymen and men for public service: men who would propagate European culture and community in the United States. Practical or technical skills were left to apprenticeships, self-teaching, or small schools housed in store shops. As a result many colleges, like Haverford, taught natural sciences, including astronomy, in a very limited capacity. Therefore, the powerful telescopes that colleges owned were underutilized because colleges were only providing basic astronomy education.</p>
										<p>Astronomy was introduced into the curriculum of American colleges in the late 18th century as a part of natural philosophy. The astronomical curriculum in American colleges was a tangential one, geared more toward producing well-rounded students than expanding the field. Throughout the 19th century, Haverford College maintained that their education &quot;kept the vocational idea in the background and exalted that of humanism,&quot; despite expressing a desire to teach science from its beginnings. Still, American colleges became the sites of some of the best and only telescopes in the United States—owning some of the largest in the world by the early 19th century. In 1854, Haverford College built a new observatory for an 8 ¼ refracting telescope, said to be the 9th largest in American at the time, but it was hardly used for astronomical discovery until the 1880s. Astronomy professors were often not dedicated astronomers and often times the &quot;excessive daily duties of the Professor…made it impossible to satisfy any demand for higher scientific investigation.&quot; While Harvard owned the largest refractor at the time, it was not used to conduct research until the late-19th century because the students and observatory benefactors used all of the available viewing time. </p>

                                        <p>However, shifting attitude towards astronomy as an academic field gave incentivized colleges to allocate more resources to its pursuit. Student interest combined with the increasing specialization of professors in American colleges in the late 19th century spurred the growth of astronomical education. After being appointed the professor of astronomy at Haverford, Isaac Sharpless went to the Cincinnati Observatory for a &quot;fortnight&quot; to learn observatory methods and calculations. At Haverford in 1881, both students and Isaac Sharpless recognized the need to acquire another telescope so that one would be free for &quot;skilled workmen&quot; to conduct research. They acknowledged that the telescopes colleges owned were unnecessarily powerful for teaching students. Toward the end of the 19th century, education in astronomy had finally gotten underway but telescopes had reached a level which colleges could not make full use of. Unfortunately for astronomers wishing to conduct research, this meant that the best telescopes could only be afforded by a few institutions that they did not have access to.</p>
