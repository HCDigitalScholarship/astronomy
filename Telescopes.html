											<h3>Development of the Telescope</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The first telescopes used for astronomy in 1609 were little more than wooden tubes with lenses at the ends. These telescopes lacked the magnifying, resolving, and positioning capabilities needed for serious astronomical research. While quadrants and armillary spheres had been perfected over hundreds of years, telescope making lacked any sort of refinement or understanding. Since the advantages of telescopes rests in their ability to collect and magnify light, their problems revolved around their abilities to do so. Refracting and reflecting telescopes had different problems given that the former used lenses and the latter used mirrors to collect light.</p>
                                        <figure class=inline-pic style="max-width:100%;">
                                        <a href="images/Refractor.jpg"><img src="images/Refractor.jpg"/></a>
                                        <figcaption>Refracting telescopes use lenses to collect and focus the light, just like binoculars do. </figcaption>
                                        </figure>
										<p>Early refracting telescopes struggled to resolve images because the lenses used bent light in a way that blurred colors around the edges when refocused, this is called chromatic aberration. The two solutions to this problem limited the utility of refracting telescopes; you either made weaker, smaller telescopes or you made ridiculously long telescopes of moderate power.  Refractors could shrink lens size to avoid chromatic aberration, but as it shrank so did the amount of light gathered. Less light meant less magnification and a smaller field of view, making small refractors too weak to use. Refractors made with larger lenses needed to be long enough to mitigate the aberration, which made them unwieldy. As where quadrants were capable of being mounted for accuracy, these telescopes, like Johannes Hevelius’s 150 foot aerial telescope, could not follow an object across the sky for prolonged observation.</p>
										<p>In 1759, John Dollond’s achromatic lens eliminated chromatic aberration and allowed powerful refractors to be made at reasonable lengths. These refractors could be then mounted to accurately follow the position of heavenly bodies across the sky. This advancement directly led to the detection of phenomena like stellar parallax because the larger lenses gathered more light from distant stars and the mounting allowed the miniscule movement to be detected. But as refractors were made with larger lenses, the weight of the glass soon became a problem. The weight would either bend the tube or the lens itself would sag under its own weight, both of which distorted the image and set a limit for the size and power of refracting telescopes.</p>
                                        <figure class="inline-pic right" style="max-width:60%;">
                                        <a href="images/Reflector.jpg"><img src="images/Reflector.jpg"/></a>
                                        <figcaption>Reflecting telescopes: light enters the tube and reflects off a curved mirror (the primary mirror) at the other end, before bouncing back up the tube to near the top where it reflects off a smaller mirror (the secondary mirror), which bounces the light to your eyepiece. </figcaption>
                                        </figure>
                                        <p>Early reflecting telescopes were preferred to refractors because they lacked aberration, since there was no lens to distort the light and image. However the speculum metal, made of tin and copper, used in the mirrors only reflected a fraction of the light collected, it also lost more of its ability as it rusted. As a result reflectors gave clear images in terms of the detail, but the light reflected was faint, which made it difficult to magnify images. As a solution, mirrors were made as large as possible to collect more light but this made the heavy speculum mirrors cumbersome. John Herschel’s 40 foot long telescope had a 48-inch mirror that weighed half a ton and required a mount the size of a large building. This again meant a telescope that struggled to accurately follow astronomical objects across the sky.</p>
