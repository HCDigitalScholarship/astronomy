						<h2><strong>Telescopes</strong></h2>
										<p>The telescope is a complex and sensitive instrument which allows for viewing 
										and measuring objects from great distances. The quality of observation depends on 
										the lenses or mirrors, the stability of the tube, the telescopeâ€™s mount, and how 
										easily it can be moved. The first telescopes were developed in 1608 in the 
										Netherlands. In 1610, Galileo began making astronomical observations with a 
										telescope, and saw the moons of Jupiter, mountains and valleys on the moon, and new
										 fixed stars. Several of these were contrary to Aristotelian principles, which 
										 explained that the sun, moon, and stars were perfect spheres embedded in fixed 
										 concentric rings and revolved forever at fixed rates. </p>

                                        <figcaption>Reflecting telescopes: light enters the tube and reflects off a curved mirror (the primary mirror) at the other end, before bouncing back up the tube to near the top where it reflects off a smaller mirror (the secondary mirror), which bounces the light to your eyepiece. </figcaption>
                                        </figure>
										 <p>The usefulness of early telescopes for astronomical observation was limited by 
										 several factors. Lenses and mirrors, which were used to collect light and magnify 
										 far-away objects, were difficult and costly to make as they required expert grinding 
										 to create the shape and clarity for a telescope. In the 19th century, only a few 
										 craftsman could create clear telescope lenses for use in the more powerful telescopes 
										 needed for astronomical research.</p>						
                                        
											<h3>Mounts and Positioning</h3>
											<p>Many early telescopes were very large and cumbersome, meaning they could not easily 
											be repositioned to track astronomical features as they moved across the sky. Telescopes 
											also required special and complex mounts. The mounting for a telescope allows the telescope 
											to rotate around an axis so that it may follow objects across the sky. These mounts require 
											fine tuning so that the movements are smooth and accurate. Haverford, when purchasing its 
											second telescope, sought advice on the effects of using a smaller mount for the new 
											telescope--Haverford was advised against this.</p>
