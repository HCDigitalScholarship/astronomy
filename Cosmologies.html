											<h3>Impact on Cosmology</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Cosmologies are the different explanations provided for the organization of the solar system, the main models are geocentric, heliocentric, and geo-heliocentric (Tychonian). Geocentric models have the Earth at the center of the universe, with the rest of the planets revolving around them. Heliocentric models have the Sun at the center of the solar system. Tychonian models have the Earth at the center of the Sun and Moon, with the rest of the planets revolving around the Sun. Heliocentric models are often thought to have been proved by Galileo’s discoveries made with the telescope. However, the first telescopes were not capable of proving heliocentric models because they were too weak or inaccurate. The telescope would need over a two hundred years of development before it could prove the heliocentricity via stellar parallax—the shifting of stars that corresponds with Earth’s annual motion. Given the distance of stars, no early telescope had the magnification or resolution to do so until the 19th century.</p>
										<p>The geocentric, or Ptolemaic, model was based on observations made by the unaided eye, meaning that no magnification was used. Viewing the planets and stars from Earth with the naked eye gives perspective that everything else revolves around us at varying intervals. Ptolemy used an armillary astrolabe, “a complex nest of seven concentric rings,” which helped take the positions of planetary bodies but did not magnify them. Because the planets and stars moved in the same patterns, Ptolemy’s model was able to consistently predict their motion. He explained this by placing the planets and stars in fixed spheres that rotated around the central Earth. Ptolemy’s geocentric model fit the available observations perfectly, and his explanation made sense given how planetary bodies appear to move when viewed by the naked eye.</p>
										<p>When Copernicus published his heliocentric model in 1543, astronomers were still viewing planetary bodies through instruments lacking any sort of magnification. Copernicus’s instruments were still the armillary sphere and quadrant that had been used over a thousand years before by Ptolemy. Copernicus’s model was not due to enhanced observation, the perspective available to the ancients was the one available to him. Instead, his was a largely philosophical and mathematical attempt to simplify the cosmological model. The basis for the Copernican model was theoretical, not observational. The goal of his cosmology was to imagine a system in which the mathematical understanding became simpler. However, because the accepted Aristotelian physics only allowed planets to move in perfect circles, his model was hardly a representation of the solar system.</p>

                                        <p>Tycho Brahe was an astronomer “in the generation between Copernicus and Galileo” whose observations were considered the best of his time. His observations, like Ptolemy’s and Copernicus’, were made with mural quadrants, quadrants mounted on walls that were made to discern greater positional accuracy. However, Tycho disagreed with the Copernican model because it did not adhere to his observational data and the available physics. To him, the planets behaved in such a way that could be explained if the Earth was only the center for some. As where Copernicus had made logical leaps in order to explain his system, Tycho adhered strictly to the evidence.</p>
                                        <p>With the creation of the telescope in 1608, Galileo was able to literally increase how much of the cosmos he could see—something no astronomer before him had been able to do. Galileo’s telescopic discoveries are often cited as evidence for Copernicus’s heliocentric model, but they failed to dislodge Earth from the center of the Universe. His discoveries clashed with Aristotelian physics but hardly proved the Earth’s motion around the sun. Theoretically, Jupiter’s moons only proved that planetary bodies could revolve around bodies other than the Earth, but it could still be the center of some. While the phases of Venus challenged the Ptolemaic model, since Venus should not have appeared fully illuminated if the Ptolemaic planetary order was correct, they did not disprove the Tychonian order. Furthermore, Galileo’s telescopes were not mounted for accuracy like quadrants, nor were they very powerful in terms of resolution and magnification. The qualitative nature of his discoveries clashed with Aristotelian physics but did not alter the way heavenly bodies seemed to move across the sky.</p>

                                        <p>Friedrich Bessel, probably seldom referred to when speaking of cosmologies, is perhaps the most important person in definitively proving the heliocentric model. Indeed, Bessel was not revolutionary in thought nor in practice, but his discovery of stellar parallax provided the definitive evidence needed to prove that the Earth revolved around the Sun. As the Earth moves around the Sun during the course of the year, the background of a star should move because the viewer’s perspective is shifting. However, because the distance to the stars is much larger than the shift in Earth’s position, this phenomena was not detected until 1838. This discovery necessitated an instrument that could accurately notice a change in the position of a star due to the Earth’s annual motion—from 10 light years away. This is akin to walking 0.2992 meters and expecting to see a change in the background of a building 90km away.

                                        As where Galileo had used a small handheld telescope, Bessel had used a large, equatorially mounted heliometer, a telescope specifically designed to follow the shifting position of planetary bodies. His discovery proved that the Earth moves and that the stars are much farther from Earth than originally thought. But because Earth’s movement around the Sun was largely accepted, his discovery did not garner much attention. Furthermore, Bessel was hardly the only astronomer looking to prove its occurrence, but he was the first.</p>
                                        <p>While the telescope was not responsible for heliocentric models and could not prove them until the 19th century, it was the only instrument that could do so. The telescope provided the enhanced view of the cosmos that was needed in an astronomy that was increasingly focused on finding the true order of the universe.</p>
