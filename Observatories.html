											<h3>Astronomical Observatories</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Looking at various astronomical observatories throughout the history of the telescope reveals that observatories and telescopes were not always as linked as they are now. Observatories predate the telescope and had their own purpose before the telescope came along. However, as the telescope became the astronomical instrument of choice, observatories became places that housed telescopes, not simply places for astronomical discovery.</p>
										<p>Early government observatories were sponsored by government officials who wanted improved navigational charts or timekeeping via positional astronomy. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich was established in 1676 in order to “improve celestial navigation” by determining the positions of planetary bodies. The main instrument from its inception was the quadrant because it was far superior in tracking position than telescopes of the time. In 1725, an instrument maker named George Graham mounted a small telescope onto a mural quadrant to augment the visual capabilities and gave it to Edmond Halley of the Royal Observatory. Half a century later, Thomas Bugge, a traveling astronomer, noted the presence of multiple quadrants and other instruments, but one telescope that could not observe above a certain degree because of “the support, which was, in a certain way, nothing but trestles.” Strong telescopes were too large to mount inside observatories and weak telescopes could not outdo mural quadrants in positioning. Far from being central to observatories, telescopes were either second to other instruments or used to improve them.</p>
										<p>Private observatories from the 17th to the 19th centuries were constructed by laymen who had an interest in astronomical discovery. Private observatories in Europe were more numerous than both college and government observatories combined. These observatories not only housed most of the telescopes in use, they mounted them in intricate ways for more accurate use. A private observatory in Wales in 1777 had a transit instrument that was mounted through the floor of the building so that the slight movements of the building would not affect the telescope. Developing observatories like these stemmed from the telescope becoming a more manageable and powerful instrument. Shorter refractors, resulting from Dollond’s achromatic lens, could be mounted inside of observatories instead of outside. These private observatories began the process of building observatories for the telescope rather than having telescopes that would then be placed in observatories.</p>

                                        <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, college observatories in England were typically small and not equipped for work in practical or research astronomy. The instruments were often a combination of quadrants and telescopes, the latter were small and not mounted for conduction any sort of measurements. By the 19th century, some of the largest refracting telescopes ever built were housed at colleges because only they could afford to buy and mount them. From the inception of the College, Haverford’s Board of Managers wrote that they wished purchase a telescope for the sake of instructing students and adding to the reputation among Friends.  Hugh Vail, the astronomy professor at Haverford College in the 1850s, pushed for the construction of a dedicated observatory with a telescope fit for astronomical research. In 1854, the college built a new observatory for an 8 ¼ refracting telescope—said to be the 9th largest in America at the time. While the Board of Managers simply wanted to build it at the site of the previous observatory, more a shack than an observatory, Vail had them move it to avoid obstructing trees and aligned it with the Earth’s axis. Powerful telescopes could no longer be mounted haphazardly, observatories themselves became a part of the telescope that further increased its capabilities. At the end of the 19th century, the building of an observatory was only for those who had acquired a telescope worth mounting for astronomical discovery.</p>
