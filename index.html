						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>Expanding the Universe problematizes the conventional wisdom of rapid scientific progress in 
						astronomy after the creation of the telescope. Instead of seeing telescopes as a solution to 
						erroneous ideas about the universe and our position in it, this exhibition illustrates the slow 
						progression of the telescope and of astronomy. When you consider the size of our solar system, let 
						alone the universe, it is understandable that early telescopes would have failed to radically change 
						astronomical ideas. The first telescopes in the early 1600s were capable of only minor discoveries 
						because they lacked magnifying power and were inaccurate in tracking moving astronomical bodies. 
						In observatories, the telescope was overlooked for instruments like quadrants, which were better 
						able to determine and track the position of astronomical objects. The telescope was not the cause 
						of radical change in cosmologies, models which demonstrate organizations of the solar system, 
						because it lacked the sensitivity to prove Earth’s motion. Furthermore, colleges did not advance 
						the telescope until the late 19th century, when it was overdeveloped in its technology but 
						under-employed in astronomical education.</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Understanding the telescope’s role in astronomy makes it possible to see why it needed to be
						 a complex and sensitive instrument. The margin of error for detecting motion at great distances,
						 such as those between the earth and the stars, is so small that even the observatory building’s 
						 movement matters. The telescope's role must be contextualized in order to appreciate its 
						 astronomical discoveries. Today, the remnants of our moon visits cannot be seen from Earth because
						  even modern telescopes cannot magnify enough to see such detail even at a comparatively short 
						  distance in space. Seeing the invention of the telescope as a watershed in which old astronomical 
						  ideas were done away with glosses over arduous scientific process. Failing to recognize that 
						  scientific discovery and progress require time and dedication creates an overly simplistic view of 
						  science that we must avoid if we are to encourage continued exploration of our universe and the 
						  questions it raises. </p>
						<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
						<p>I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the continued support and guidance of Magill’s staff. To Sarah Horowitz for her patience and encouragement through hundreds of iterations of this exhibition. To Krista Oldham for her positive attitude and collection findings. To Bruce Bumbarger for his continued interest and for making this exhibition a physical reality. To Mike Zarafonetis for giving the exhibition a digital dimension. To Yutong Li for her hard work in creating the exhibition website. To Terry Snyder for her support through this and many other endeavors. And finally, to the O’Donnell family and supporters of the Joe O’Donnell Student Library Research internship for this amazing opportunity.</p>
